If this looks too complicated for you, I intend to release the occational source code zip that will contain everything you need in one place. It doesn't hurt to prod me.

Prerequisites:
Visual C# 2010 or greater (express works): http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/express
XNA Game Studio 4.0: http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=23714


This project relies on four other projects, three on SourceForge and one on Google Code. You will need to checkout all projects into the same root directory as Asteroid Outpost.

The required projects are:
QuadTree: https://sourceforge.net/projects/quadtree/
2D XNA Primitive Shapes Library: https://sourceforge.net/projects/primitives2d/
2D XNA HUD: https://sourceforge.net/projects/xnahud/
XNASpriteLib: http://code.google.com/p/xnaspritelib/

I would recommend using Tortoise SVN that can be downloaded for free here: http://tortoisesvn.net/

The respective SVN paths are:
https://quadtree.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/quadtree/trunk
https://primitives2d.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/primitives2d/trunk
https://xnahud.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/xnahud/trunk
http://xnaspritelib.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/

They will need to be placed in directories called "QuadTree", "Primitives2D", "XNAHUD", and "XNASpriteLib" respectively.

When you are all done, you should have a directory structure that looks like this (solution files are provided below only as a reference):

[Your Projects]/Asteroid Outpost/Asteroid Outpost.sln
[Your Projects]/QuadTree/QuadTree.sln
[Your Projects]/Primitives2D/Primitives2D.sln
[Your Projects]/XNAHUD/XNAHUD.sln
[Your Projects]/XNASpriteLib/XNASpriteLib.sln


Opening the Asteroid Outpost solution will open the primary projects for the sub-projects. If you open either sub-project solutions, you will open the primary project, as well as any testing applications I/we have designed.

If you have any questions, comments, or ideas, I would love to hear them at: jcpmcdonald@gmail.com
